🎯PLUGIN MOTIVATION*navigate-note-🧭navigate-📝note.nvim-🎯plugin-motivation*

Navigating through project files and understanding them by taking notes is a
crucial task for developers. While there are many tools available for
navigation, such as arrow.nvim <https://github.com/otavioschwanck/arrow.nvim>
and harpoon <https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon>, they often lack
integrated note-taking capabilities aligned with navigation.
`navigate-note.nvim` aims to bridge this gap.


📐DESIGN PHILOSOPHY*navigate-note-🧭navigate-📝note.nvim-📐design-philosophy*

`navigate-note.nvim` creates a `nav.md` note in your project’s root
directory. This allows you to take notes and add links to files, facilitating
navigation between them. By interleaving notes and file links, `navigate-note`
aligns navigation with your understanding of the project.


📦INSTALLATION   *navigate-note-🧭navigate-📝note.nvim-📦installation*

>lua
    -- Lazy.nvim
    {
      "you-n-g/navigate-note.nvim",
      config=true,

🎥DEMO                   *navigate-note-🧭navigate-📝note.nvim-🎥demo*

>
    A demo showcasing how to use the plugin will be available soon. If you're eager to try it out, simply press `<m-h>` (for example, `alt+h`) to launch the plugin.
<


📖FEATURES & USAGE ~

- Nav Mode
    - `<m-h>`: Switch to the `nav.md` file, your main hub for notes and navigation. If you’re already in `nav.md`, it takes you back to the last file you were on.
    - `<m-p>`: Add the current file and line to `nav.md`. This is great for bookmarking important code sections.
    - `<m-cr>`: Open the file and line under the cursor in `nav.md`.
- Tab Jumping and Preview
    - `<tab>`: Move to the next `file:line` in `nav.md`.
    - `<s-tab>`: Move to the previous `file:line`.
    - A floating window shows a preview of the file content when you use `<tab>`.
- Fast Navigating
    - `<numbers>`: Jump to the i-th "file:line" entry.
- Peeking Mode
    - Get a quick look at file content without fully opening it.
    - Use `<c-a>` and `<c-x>` to change the line number in the preview.
- Jump Mode
    - Toggle between jumping to the file only or to the exact `file:line` with `<m-l>`.
    - In file-only mode, go to the start of the file; in file:line mode, go to the specific line.


⚙️ADVANCED SETUP*navigate-note-🧭navigate-📝note.nvim-⚙️advanced-setup*

>lua
    -- Lazy.nvim
    {
      "you-n-g/navigate-note.nvim",
      opts = {
            filename = "nav.md", -- The filename of the markdown.
            width = 0.6, -- The width of the popup window when jumping in the file with <tab>.
            keymaps = {
                nav_mode = {
                    -- Navigation & Jumping
                    next = "<tab>",
                    prev = "<s-tab>",
                    open = "<m-cr>",
                    switch_back = "<m-h>", -- Switch back to the previous file from `nav.md`.
                    -- Editing
                    append_link = "<m-p>", -- (P)aste will more align with the meaning.
                    -- Mode switching
                    jump_mode = "<m-l>", -- When we jump to a file, jump to the file only or jump to the exact file:line.
                },
                add = "<localleader>na",
                open_nav = "<m-h>", -- Switch to `nav.md`.
            },
            context_line_count = { -- It would be a total of `2 * context_line_count - 1` lines.
                tab = 8,
                vline = 2,
            },
      }
